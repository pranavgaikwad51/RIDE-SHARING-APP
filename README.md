# RIDE-SHARING-APP

# ðŸš— Ride Sharing App (Python OOP Project)

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that simulates a simple ride-sharing platform using core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

## ðŸ§  OOP Concepts Used

- **Class & Object** â€“ Modeling `User`, `Driver`, `Passenger`, and `RideShareApp`
- **Encapsulation** â€“ Driver availability state is hidden and managed through methods
- **Inheritance** â€“ `Driver` and `Passenger` inherit from `User`
- **Polymorphism** â€“ Method overriding with different roles
- **Abstraction** â€“ Users do not need to know how drivers are assigned
